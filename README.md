# Predicting whether or not a review is positive or negative based on key words
This was a homework assignment for my Machine Learning class where we where given the task of predicting a review is positive or negative. The key words we used to determine this where Great, Happy, Bad, and Return. The algorithm used has to do with Text Classification using Naive Bayes.
## Explination and Calculations
This can be found in ModelBasis.txt and involves solving the problem by hand. I did use pandas to assist in this because it made it easier to get the count for each keyword in the reviews.
## Implementation of Algorithm
This can be found in main.py it's basically a Python implementation model from ModelBasis.txt. All of the values in it are consistent with the ones calculated meaning the implementation works. This part wasn't required for undergraduate students but I chose to do it as a challenge for my understanding of machine learning implementations in Python.
