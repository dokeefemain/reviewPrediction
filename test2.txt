iPhone 7 Black came in excellent condition. Like new. No scratches or scuffs. Works great. Was happy for couple months until phone started to develop issues with hearing callers and vs versa. Callers can’t hear me and I can’t hear callers, the sound is bad. Checked settings . Disabled WiFi calling. Hard reset phone. Updated iOS. Happens randomly. Suspect possible known defects on iPhone 7 with audio IC chips. I want to return the phone but I’m waiting to se for a month
